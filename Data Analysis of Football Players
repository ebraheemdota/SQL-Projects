SELECT player_name, club, ROUND(AVG(pass_accuracy),2) AS avg_pass_accuracy, match_played, position
FROM distribution
GROUP BY player_name, club, distribution
ORDER BY avg_pass_accuracy DESC;

-- Determine whether players in different positions (e.g., forward, midfielder, defender) have different pass accuracy levels by categorizing them as "High Pass Accuracy", "Medium Pass Accuracy", or "Low Pass Accuracy".
SELECT player_name, club, position, ROUND(AVG(pass_accuracy),2) AS avg_pass_accuracy,

ORDER BY avg_pass_accuracy DESC;

--  Retrieve player names, positions, and the number of tackles made from the "defending" table. Left join with the "disciplinary" table to also include the number of yellow cards received by each player.
SELECT defending.player_name, defending.position, SUM(defending.tackles)
FROM defending
